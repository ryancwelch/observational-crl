# Algorithms for Causal Disentanglement from Purely Observational Data

This repository contains an implementation of the necessary algorithms to recover upstream-layer representations of latent causal graphs as formulated in the paper [Identifiability Guarantees for Causal Disentanglement from Purely Observational Data](https://openreview.net/forum?id=M20p6tq9Hq&noteId=0KDq5QK0Sw). The algorithms are capable of recovering both upstream-layer represensentations of latent variables and layer representations of the exogenous noise terms in non-linear additivive Gaussian noise models transformed via linear mixing. The method is intended to work and be studied with the use of accurate second order score estimators.
